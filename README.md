chesstail
=========

``chesstail`` logs all moves in all correspondance games played by a given
group of Chess.com users. We use this snippet together with ``irccat.py`` from
the Python IRC library to track all moves on our IRC channel (see
``run_smm.sh``).

BTW, Chess.com admins/coders, should (using) this project somehow violate the
site's rules and regulations, please let me know and I will take it down
immediately.
