=========

``chesstail`` logs all moves in all correspondance games played by a given
group of Chess.com users. We use this snippet together with a simple IRC bot
(``irccat.py``) to track all moves on an IRC channel.

BTW, Chess.com admins/coders, should (using) this project somehow violate the
site's rules and regulations, please let me know and I will take it down
immediately.
